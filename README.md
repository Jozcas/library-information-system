## Description of library information system
The system is a library information system designed for unregistered users to browse and filter books. For registered users, it allows searching for books, checking the availability of specific titles, and making reservations or managing borrowed books. Distributors can add new book titles or check requests for book deliveries to increase the availability of high-demand titles. Librarians can manage reservations at the library to which they are assigned to, add new books to the catalog, and make orders for new books. The last role is the administrator, who has the rights of a librarian but can also assign librarians to libraries and manage their permissions.
